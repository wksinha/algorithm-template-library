# Algorithm Template Library
A collection of algorithms for competitive programming contests.  
This is a **work-in-progress**. For a more complete version, algorithms in Java can be found under the `archive/old-version` branch.

## Algorithms
The following classes of algorithms can be found implemented.  
Some vectorized alternatives have also been added for comparison.

### I/O
Auxiliary templates for efficient, convenient I/O.
- Standard I/O
- Fast I/O

### Sorting
A comparative analysis of various sorting algorithms, including vectorization, is included.  
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion + Quick Sort (Hybrid)

### Pattern Matching
A comparative analysis of various pattern matching algorithms, including vectorization, is included.  
For completeness, the following need to be included: `aho-corasick algorithm`, `suffix-array`.
- Naive (Vectorized)
- KMP
- Z-Function

## Modular Integers
A basic modular arithmetic library.
- Arithmetic
- Binary Exponentiation
- Modular Muliplicative Inverse

## Todo
- Include range query data structures
- Upload tests, benchmarks, and, establish Git-Hooks
